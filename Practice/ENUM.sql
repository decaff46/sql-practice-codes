-- ENUM 

USE classicmodels;
/*
ENUM is a string object whose value is chosen from a list of permitted values defined at the time of column creation.

The ENUM data type provides the following advantages:

    Compact data storage. MySQL ENUM uses numeric indexes (1, 2, 3, â€¦) to represents string values.
    Readable queries and output.

    ...
    col ENUM ('value1','value2','value3'),
    ...
);

/*
-- disadvantages:
1. 	Changing enumeration members requires rebuilding the entire table using the ALTER TABLE statement, which is expensive in terms of resources and time.
2. 	Getting the complete enumeration list is complex because you need to access the information_schema database:

SELECT 
    column_type
FROM
	information_schema.COLUMNS
WHERE
	TABLE_NAME = 'tickets' AND COLUMN_NAME = 'priority';

3. 	Porting to other RDBMS could be an issue because ENUM is not SQL-standard and not many database system support it.
4. 	Adding more attributes to the enumeration list is impossible. 
	Suppose you want to add a service agreement for each priority e.g., High (24h), Medium (1-2 days), Low (1 week), it is not possible with ENUM. 
	In this case, you need to have a separate table for storing priority list e.g., priorities(id, name, sort_order, description) 
	and replace the priority field in the tickets table by priority_id that references to the id field of the priorities table.

5. 	Comparing to the look-up table (priorities), an enumeration list is not reusable. For example, if you want to create a new table named tasks and want to reuse the priority list, it is not possible.
